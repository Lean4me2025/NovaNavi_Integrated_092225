NOVA + NAVI Integrated Flow (Static Build)
-----------------------------------------
Flow:
1) index.html (Welcome)
2) traits.html (Trait Selection â€” stores to localStorage)
3) results.html (Snapshot + CTA to Reflection)
4) reflection.html (Select 1 of 4; Save & Continue enables)
5) offers.html (2x2 grid of Payhip green buttons; IDs included)
6) navi.html (NAVI Start; displays your Reflection selection)

Payhip Buttons (set to Available on your dashboard):
- Starter: GdfU7
- Pro: knC1Z
- Pro Suite: re4Hy
- Book: N7Lvg

Notes:
- Pure static HTML/CSS/JS; no frameworks; deploy anywhere (Vercel-ready).
- Reflection page enables "Save & Continue" ONLY after a selection is made.
- Offers page uses Payhip's embed script in <head>; buttons are green by request.
- Traits page uses placeholder "Trait 01..50" names. Replace as needed by editing traits.html.

Deployment:
- Upload this folder or the ZIP to your repo; set Vercel to serve index.html as root.
- Each page has top navigation links for quick QA.
