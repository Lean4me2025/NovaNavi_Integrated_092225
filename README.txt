NOVA + NAVI Integrated Flow — v2 (Cache-Busting + 50 Traits Guaranteed)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sequence:
1) index.html
2) traits.html  (renders ALL 50 strengths; count shown in page text)
3) results.html (shows how many were selected; confirms total available = 50)
4) reflection.html (Save & Continue unlocks on selection)
5) offers.html (2x2 grid, green Payhip buttons: GdfU7, knC1Z, re4Hy, N7Lvg)
6) navi.html

Built-in fixes:
- Cache-busting meta headers on every page to prevent stale assets.
- CSS grid tuned for 4/3/2 columns responsive; no max-height clipping.
- Traits hardcoded (50 labels) — guaranteed render with no external data.

Deploy:
- Upload ZIP to your repo, deploy on Vercel.
- If you still see fewer than 50 traits, hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) once.
